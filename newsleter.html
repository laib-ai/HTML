     Wind Energy
      Using wind turbines, we can convert the energy in wind into mechanical energy! Originally used for sails, windmills, and windpumps, it is now used for electricity. Wind power benefits local communities, creating extra revenue to put toward school budgets, the reduction of household taxes, and address infrastructure projects.<br>
    Solar Energy
      Solar energy is based on the sun's radiation, and technologies such as photovoltaics (PV) and concentrating solar-      thermal power (CSP) capture this radiation for use. Solar panels use PV to absorb cells and creates energy with        electrical charges that move  in response to an internal electrical field in PV cells, causing electricity to flow. CSP is used in mirrors to reflect and concentrate solar energy onto receivers, which convert to heat.
This is stored later to produce electricity or conveniency
