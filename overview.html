     Wind Energy
      You must have your system installed by a professional installer! If you sign up for communityGREEN's services, you may have this installation covered! You must maintain your system, which includes: checking and tigtening bolts and electrical connections as necessary, checking machines for corrosion and guy wires for proper tension, checking for and replace any worn leading edge tape on the turbine blades, if necessary, and replacing components such as turbine blades and/or bearings if needed.<br>
    Solar Energy
    Through a qualified professional, you may have access to your own solar panel system! Through our services, you can have your installation covered! Maintenance is required, with additional pay from the installer.
